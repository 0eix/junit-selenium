Automated Testing for Basic Addition Web App
============================================

This Java testing code utilizes the Selenium framework to automate the testing of a simple web application designed for addition calculations. The web application is hosted at https://0eix.github.io/somme/. The test cases cover various scenarios to ensure the accuracy of the addition functionality. By interacting with the input fields and the "Calculate" button, the tests validate both positive and negative integer additions. These automated tests contribute to the quality assurance process of the web application, confirming that it functions correctly across different inputs. The test suite demonstrates how automated testing can be employed to ensure the reliability of web-based features.
